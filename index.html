		<h2>Background /Past</h2>
        <p class="first">Hello I am Antonette  I am 32 years old and was born in the Philippines.  I came from a small city called Mexico Pampanga which is about a two-hour ride North from Manila the capital city. My mother was a stay at home mom and my father worked as a tractor driver for a farm.</p>
        <p>After finishing high school I started to work as a sales clerk at SM Department store. I worked there for 6 months and received a scholarship to learn biology unfortunately I was not able to complete the degree due to lack of finances. Shortly after stopping school I was petitioned by a family member in 2009 to come to USA and moved to Burbank.</p>

		<h2>Recent/ Present</h2>
        <p>Shortly after coming to the United States I got a job being a caregiver at a facility taking care of patients that are elderly and or have disabilities. I later got my license to be a CNA (Certified Nursing Assistant). I also got my BLS (Basic Life Support) Cert and HHA (Home Health Aid) Cert. </p>
        <p><span class="sentence">In 2014 I became a U.S. Citizen and was sworn in during a ceremony in Downtown San Diego. When I video called to tell my mother after the ceremony, she cried.</span>
        For my spare time I am mostly a home body. However, I enjoy cooking, walking in the park with friends, playing shooting games like call of duty, shopping and watching Netflix. I also like traveling and have gone to the San Diego Zoo X6, Sea Word X8, hiking x10 and Disney Land X5.</p>

        </figure><h2>Near Future/ Goals</h2>
        <p>My plans for the future include becoming a Physical Therapy assistant. I plan on attending <a href="https://www.concorde.edu/campus/san-diego-california?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=knowledge&utm_term=sandiego&SourceID=GO1106" target="_blank"> Concord College</a>. I will need to study more before going there since English is my Second language and while I speak English fluently, I have some work to do with writing. I have chosen Physical Therapy because of its long term career outlook and I like working with people.</p>
